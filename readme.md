# DESIGN PROCESS AND IDEAS/IMPLEMENTATION  
This terminal app is supposed to mimmic a virtual/online movie database/rental buisness.  The app currently has features in it that allow the user to navigate from a home/main menu through the program depending on what they want to do. Currently, they can check our database and find out what films we have/what films are available to rent. Users can also add a movie to the database alongside a corresponding rating.Once successfully added, users are able to see the movie they added by reprinting the movie list!  

I went through a few different ideas and functionality levels of different terminal apps before arriving at the current one thanks to a suggestion from an educator.  As a means of working as efficiently as possible, i was able to take code-along class work, rebuild it from the ground up and redesign it and further turn it into a new app.Using material i was familiar with really made me feel a lot more comfortable about this project because i was able to take what we'd learnt and play with it in a familiar environment.

The design process was made easier by collaborating with Trello; any design ideas i had were made into a card, the idea then went into production for a while until i could decide if it would make the cut or not. If the idea did not make the cut, it was moved to a tree called "scrapped functionality planning".  

Overall, a few things were used for the design process, in an effort to keep this documentation as brief as possible, the design processes used were as follows:  
- **Trello**  - (used to spitball ideas and keep track of what was implemented/what worked/didnt work)
- **Diagram/Flowcharting** - (used to visual how the app would function and communicate with itself)  
- **Slide Decks** - (used to present functionality,planning, design processes)
- **Hand written journal/drawings** - (used to quickly scribble ideas out and solve functionality issues)

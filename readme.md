# DESIGN PROCESS AND IDEAS/IMPLEMENTATION  
This terminal app is supposed to mimmic a virtual/online movie database/rental buisness.  The app currently has features in it that allow the user to navigate from a home/main menu through the program depending on what they want to do. Currently, they can check our database and find out what films we have/what films are available to rent. Users can also add a movie to the database alongside a corresponding rating.Once successfully added, users are able to see the movie they added by reprinting the movie list!  

I went through a few different ideas and functionality levels of different terminal apps before arriving at the current one thanks to a suggestion from an educator.  As a means of working as efficiently as possible, i was able to take code-along class work, rebuild it from the ground up and redesign it and further turn it into a new app.Using material i was familiar with really made me feel a lot more comfortable about this project because i was able to take what we'd learnt and play with it in a familiar environment.

The design process was made easier by collaborating with Trello; any design ideas i had were made into a card, the idea then went into production for a while until i could decide if it would make the cut or not. If the idea did not make the cut, it was moved to a tree called "scrapped functionality planning".  

Overall, a few things were used for the design process, in an effort to keep this documentation as brief as possible, the design processes used were as follows:  
- **Trello**  - (used to spitball ideas and keep track of what was implemented/what worked/didnt work)
- **Diagram/Flowcharting** - (used to visual how the app would function and communicate with itself)  
- **Slide Decks** - (used to present functionality,planning, design processes)
- **Hand written journal/drawings** - (used to quickly scribble ideas out and solve functionality issues)  

#  FEATURES  
## THE THREE FEATURES OF MY TERMINAL APP ARE:
- ADD MOVIE TO DATABASE
- EDIT RATING OF MOVIE IN/ADDED TO DATABASE
- RENT MOVIE


### **FEATURE 1:**  
My first feature is the "Edit Rating" feature. In my program, there is a predefined list with 6 or so movies. All of these movies come with a preassigned rating. Users are able to edit the rating of this movie by selecting the "edit rating" option from the main menu. They will then be prompted to provide the name of the movie they are editing as well as the new rating they are assigning to it.   
Users are also able to edit the rating of a movie they have added via the same methodology.  

### **FEATURE 2:**  
My second feature is the "Add a movie" feature. Users are able to select this option from the main menu. The program will prompt them to provide a name and a rating for the movie they're adding.  

### **FEATURE 3:**  
My third feature is the "Rent a movie". Users are able to choose a movie from the list and choose how long they wish to rent the movie for. There is a maximum rental allowance length of 19 days. Should users exceed that length when they are prompted, they will be denied rental.  

### **HONOURABLE MENTIONS:**  
Users also have the ability to delete movies from the list. They are able to delete movies that were already present when the program began and/or movies that they've added themselves.  
Users can also see the menu at any time by following the prompt to display the menu.
